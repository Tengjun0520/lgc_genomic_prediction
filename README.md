# LGC genomic prediction

## Model summary

We presented three novel models for incorporating local genetic correlations into multi-trait genomic prediction and compared our model with the conventional multi-trait genomic prediction model (MTGBLUP) and single trait model (STGBLUP). The models is as follows,
