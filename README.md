LGC genomic prediction model 3

  Step 1: estimate the genetic value for each trait derived from the STGBLUP model (1.gblup.sh); Step 2: obtain SNP effects from the genetic value (2.gc_to_snpeff.py); Step 3: reweight SNP effects using the estimated local genetic correlations and calculate the adjusted genetic value (3.reweight_snpeff.py).
